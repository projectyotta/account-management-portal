# account-management-portal
I had to develop this as a part of my internship . I was not allowed to take the code I had written in their premises ( for obvious reasons ) , 
so I recreated the entire thing on my laptop again. 

This is mainly an account management portal. Useful for scenarios where a manager has to assign contracts and projects to employees and the employees have to view it. 
The employees can also view an image gallery ( used for uploading pictures of team outings etc ) , which they can upload too.
